This module contains utility functions and other shared functionality used in the Foundry VTT modules for Miska's Maps.

Current functions include a basic "ladder" function for regions and a teleporter dialog to move tokens between regions.
I am currenlty unhappy with the teleporter implementation and it will be improved when I have the time.

In future a variant picker will likely be developed to more easily change between different variants of maps.
