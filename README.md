This module contains utility functions and other shared functionality used in the Foundry VTT modules for Miska's Maps.

Current functions include a basic "ladder" function for regions and a teleporter dialog to move tokens between regions.
The teleporter feature is still rough around the edges, and I'll improve it when I have the time.

In the future, a variant picker will likely be developed to more easily change between different variants of maps.
